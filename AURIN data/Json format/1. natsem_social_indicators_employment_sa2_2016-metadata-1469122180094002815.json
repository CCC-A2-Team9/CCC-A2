The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).<br/><br/>\n\n\nThis indicator is the number and proportion of people employed. The rate is calculated as the number employed divided by the total number in that Age/Sex group (excluding Not Stated). Note that the denominator for the total employment rate is total population aged 15-64.<br/><br/>\n\n\nAll indicators were extracted from the ABS Tablebuilder system using the usual residence profile. For usual residence data, the ABS moves people back to where they live, rather than using the location the data were collected (place of enumeration). Usual residence data is preferred for individual level data because it removes the effect of respondents travelling or holidaying.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please view the <a href=\"https://apps.aurin.org.au/gate/technicalreports/NATSEM/AURIN%20Social%20Data%20Technical%20Report%20Nov%202018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NATSEM Technical Report</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.</li>\n<li>Where data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.</li>\n<li>The treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.</li>\n<li>Methodology between the 2016 NATSEM and 2011 OECD data release may have changed, please refer to the technical report for parity status and specific changes.</li>\n</ul>\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_code16","type":"String","title":"SA2 Code","description":"SA2 Code.","isDimension":false},{"name":"employment_female","type":"Integer","title":"Number of employed females in the area","description":"SEXP = 2 & Labour Force Status_LFSP = Sum of (1 2 3).","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"employment_female_15_24","type":"Integer","title":"Number of employed females aged 15 -
