1. The attributes of the data for Scenarios 1 reflect only SA2 Name and no SA2 code, so the retrieval data will need to be based on SA2 Name
2. The suburb named West Melbourne in the data for Scenarios2 & 3 is null, so this suburb is deleted
3. The reference for Melbourne's suburbs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Melbourne_suburbs
